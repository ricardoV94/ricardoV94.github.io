Why? First, there are many good resources out there explaining how to derive the gamma distribution from first principles, usually involving these idealized things called poisson processes. These are great sources and I would definitely recommend them. This one by Aerin Kim is amazing.
However, more often than not, people use gamma distributions in real world problems for much more mundane reasons: It&amp;rsquo;s a well behaved yet flexible positive continuous distribution.</description></item></channel></rss>
