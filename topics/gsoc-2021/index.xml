One such algorithm is the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler which is capable of drawing samples from complex posterior distributions (e.g., multimodal distributions).
In addition to traditional Bayesian inference, SMC can also be used to perform Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which allows one to define models without a pure mathematical likelihood term, which is difficult to derive in many complex real world problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
