Instead of creating a single Markov Chain, SMC works by keeping track of a large population of samples, which, in a similar spirit to Genetic Algorithms can be &amp;ldquo;selected&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mutated&amp;rdquo; to evolve a better &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; to the posterior distribution.</description></item><item><title>A most unprincipled derivation of the gamma distribution</title><link>https://ricardov94.github.io/posts/gamma_distribution/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ricardov94.github.io/posts/gamma_distribution/</guid><description>Introduction # In this article I will derive the gamma distribution in a most unprincipled way.
Why? First, there are many good resources out there explaining how to derive the gamma distribution from first principles, usually involving these idealized things called poisson processes. These are great sources and I would definitely recommend them. This one by Aerin Kim is amazing.
However, more often than not, people use gamma distributions in real world problems for much more mundane reasons: It&amp;rsquo;s a well behaved yet flexible positive continuous distribution.</description></item><item><title>Hello, World</title><link>https://ricardov94.github.io/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ricardov94.github.io/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Introduction # Not much to see here</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ricardov94.github.io/topics/gsoc-2021/proposal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ricardov94.github.io/topics/gsoc-2021/proposal/</guid><description>PyMC3: Make SMC-ABC faster and more flexible # Intro # PyMC3 provides state-of-the-art tools to specify rich mathematical probabilistic models and algorithms to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution of such models conditioned on observed data. One such algorithm is the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler which is capable of drawing samples from complex posterior distributions (e.g., multimodal distributions).
In addition to traditional Bayesian inference, SMC can also be used to perform Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which allows one to define models without a pure mathematical likelihood term, which is difficult to derive in many complex real world problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
